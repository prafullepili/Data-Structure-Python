# Structure of a Singly Linked List Node
A **Singly Linked List (SLL)** is a linear data structure where each element (called a **node**) points to the next node in the sequence. It’s a dynamic data structure, meaning its size can grow or shrink during runtime, unlike arrays.

---
Each node in an SLL has two components:
1. **Data**: The actual value stored in the node.
2. **Next**: A pointer/reference to the next node in the list.

## Visualization

Here’s a simple representation of an SLL:
  ```
  |---------------|          |----------------|          |----------------|          |----------------|          |----------------|
  |  10  |  --------------------> 20  |  --------------------> 30  |  -------------------> 40  |  -----------------> 50  |  None  |
  |---------------|          |----------------|          |----------------|          |----------------|          |----------------|
  
  ```

- The `None` at the end signifies the end of the list.

## Operations on Singly Linked List

### 1. Traversal
- Visit each node starting from the head (first node) and follow the links to the end.

### 2. Insertion
- At the beginning.
- At the end.
- At a specific position.

### 3. Deletion
- Remove a node from the beginning.
- Remove a node from the end.
- Remove a node from a specific position.

### 4. Search
- Find if a particular value exists in the list.

## Advantages of SLL
- **Dynamic Size**: Can grow or shrink as needed.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: No need to shift elements like in an array.

---
## Disadvantages of SLL
- **Sequential Access**: Traversing the list takes O(n) time.
- **Memory Overhead**: Each node requires extra memory for the pointer.
